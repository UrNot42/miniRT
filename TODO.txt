April 1st TODO
1 - Putting rendering inside wrap (Easy - long?)
	- mlx hook
	- mlx loop implementation
2 - Parsing actually making correct scene (Intense Debug)
	- Putting position and orientation inside matrix objects
	- Defining Camera
3 - Debug Parsing with edge case maps
4 - Disambiguate t_scene with proper t_cam and t_alight instead of t_obj

Bonus
1 + Patterns (chill)
2 + Transparancy (? High tier)
3 + Reflectivity (? High tier)
